Subject: H-1B Visa Expiring Soon â€” Request to Discuss Options Due to Government Shutdown

To: Martin Zhang <mzhang@gibney.com>

Hi Martin,

We would like to understand the options available to remain in the U.S. and continue working if the government shutdown continues and the Department of Labor does not reopen before our visa expiration dates.

Could we schedule a 30-minute Zoom call to review our situation and possible next steps?

Thank you for your time and guidance.

Best regards,
