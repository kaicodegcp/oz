VC host is 4n9wpd5l.cde-k4sg67rt.apps.mlab-ctigtdcai03d.ecs.dyn.nsroot.net (two labels before apps). A wildcard like *.apps... only matches one label (e.g., console-openshift-console.apps...), not X.Y.apps.... So it will work for the OCP console, but not necessarily for CDE VC routesâ€”unless the cert actually includes *.cde-k4sg67rt.apps... in its SANs (which is what Cloudera requested).
